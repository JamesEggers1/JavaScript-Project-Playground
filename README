This project is a simple sandbox for me to play around and try different ideas for structuring JavaScript files in web project since at it's inception, there is very little guidance on such.

Goals:
- Build a file directory structure that promotes a more consistent and pattern.
- Keep 3rd party frameworks in a separate directory
- Keep tests in a separate directory
- Promote Code Reusability
- Focus on Concepts more than framework integration.

General Structure:
- lib - used for 3rd party libraries (e.g. jQuery)
- src - home of custom source files
- tests - home of test files

Current Dependencies:
- jQuery <http://www.jquery.com> (Licensed under the MIT and GPL licenses)
- JsTestDriver <http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/>
